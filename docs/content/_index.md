# Language

## It should

- Be ultra configurable and extensible at **every** point
- Be declarative over imperative (functional)
- Have commands and the cli be first class citizens
- Be as strict as you make it but guess everywhere else
- Be good at guessing (perhaps ... magical?)
- Allow testing to be a first class citizen while still letting the code say what
  it wants to say (tests should bend to code not the other way around)
- Stuff should just be included
